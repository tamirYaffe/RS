The pickled noodles with shredded pork was my favourite. The Shanghai fired noodles was too soggy and drenched with too much oil, and the pan fried onion cake was just so wrong. It was maligned by the deep fryer.

There have been some real misses in years' passed, but every visit in 2012 has been enjoyable.  Tonight's dinner was simply perfect.  I had a steak with potato and the wife had the grilled chicken breast (she had them leave the bbq sauce in the kitchen) with a side of grilled zucchini.  We both opted for the salad bar. Every bite was delicious and cooked perfectly.

Even the silly little cheesy ""biscuits"" were good tonight (those can be hit or miss, but tonight they were definitely good).

The service has been excellent this year, too, and we're noticing that the staff isn't changing as quickly as it did for a while.  Must be a new manager or something.  Whatever it is, the prices are good, the menu is simple but has good choices and the classic RT salad bar is never a disappointment.  The interior decor is very comfortable.  We both like that they keep the lights a little low, makes for a nicer meal."

I thought I had made reservations through the automated system but my age must be showing because they didn't have us on the list and thus no outside seating and wow, they have some lovely outside seating among these great heavily leafed trees but still, seated in less than 15 minutes.

Instead of full meals we shared a series of appetizers. I wasn't crazy ab out the Bruschetta but the lamb meatballs were good. My parents also enjoyed the hummus and I guess my overall favorite was the fresh sliced bread with the pesto sauce amazing. I did have a cocktail, the Cactus Blossom and the server did warn me it was on the sweet side but honestly, taste reminded me somewhat of cough syrup so I won't order that one again. However, you get your money's worth as I definitely felt the cocktail when it was done.

I guess I thought the food was good but what I especially liked was that the place had that operational hum of excellence which I've come to expect from the Fox Restaurants Concepts group.

This location is okay -- I've never had a problem with the service. This location has outdoor seating that faces the Bethany Home\/16 St intersection. There's a nice view of the mountains to the northeast. 

Some other facets of the location I am compelled to warn you about. 

1. Parking -- not much of it, and very tight. You risk being towed if you don't watch where you park. Other businesses are on this corner and they're very protective of their parking. 
2. Getting in and out -- on the Bethany Home side, you really need to be driving east to turn in (right). Otherwise, it needs to be 8 p.m. On the 16th St side, you really need to turn right to go north on 16th -- turning left will hold up everyone behind you and you need to watch for traffic in at least 4 lanes. Again, to make a south turn on 16th St it really needs to be REALLY early in the morning or REALLY late at night. Any other time of day and you're asking for a fender-bender. 

It's an okay location; you just need to be careful how you come in and leave, and where you park."

Located at the back of Carmel Commons, off of Carmel Rd, the parking spaces seemed a bit narrow, so I parked at the end of the lot as to not get my doors banged up.  On a Friday around 2:00, there wasn't much of a crowd at all and I was quickly seated and then almost immediately greeted by my server.  My drink order of a Coke Zero was brought quickly and kept filled.  I really enjoyed the complimentary salsa and tortilla chips.  The salsa is a well blended mix of tomatoes and other ingredients, which is what I prefer to the chunkier salsas.  It was also not overwhelmingly cilantro'ed, which I was very happy about.  An order of cheese dip came quickly to the table and it was delicious.  Creamy and well flavored, and the tortilla chips were perfectly salted and held up well to the queso.

My lunch order was a steak Chimichanga - shredded beef in a flour tortilla, covered with queso and served with rice and beans.  The rice beans were both mexican restaurant standard issue, though better than most.  The beans were a good consistency and the rice wasn't a dried out mess.  The meat inside of the chimichanga was well seasoned.

Though I had to unbutton my pants, I did finish my lunch and it was very good.  Service was excellent.  Price was average.  I will definitely return to Cabo's."

I have been preparing vegan meals these past few days and my carnivorous husband has been such a trooper trying my cooking.  Well, apparently tonight he had enough of the kale and soy protein posing as beef, and was in the mood for some good ol' soul food. 

With a raving recommendation from one of his patients- we gave M&M Soul Food Cafe a try.  The complimentary cornbread pancakes already made such a great first impression.  Being a loyal customer of the original Roscoe's House of chicken and waffles in LA, I had to try M&M's version.  I feel like such a traitor because Roscoe's has NOTHING on them.  The seasoning on the fried chicken wings was so delicious, I was actually licking my fingers after every bite.  It was perfectly seasoned and not overly salty at all.  The waffles were also fabulous. A little sweeter than I am used to, but that was OK because it just meant I didn't need the syrup. The sweet and salty combo was perfection.  I ordered a side of fried okra which were OK and the collard greens that I devoured. 

My husband ordered the smothered chicken (dark meat) and that too was delicious. He ordered sides of yams and mac n' cheese.  The sides were good too, but the chicken was definitely the star.  There is no ""kids menu"" but our toddler daughter ate from our plates and was licking her fingers too!

To top it off, we finished the meal with some peach cobbler and it was the perfect sweet finish to a fabulous meal.  We originally wanted to try the BBQ short ribs but they had just run out when we came in, so that just gives us an excuse to come back even sooner (after a few nights of vegan meals, of course). 

Tim, the owner, made us feel at home from the second we sat down to the second we walked out the door.  And we actually did feel like we were at home, because we were able to watch the NBA playoffs as well."

The store itself is larger than many other comic stores. Most of the middle of the store is dedicated to tables. When we walked in on a Saturday there were four or five games going on. It looks like a popular place to play Magic or Warhammer. 

The selection of boardgames was good, and I appreciated the ""Free Boardgames to play"" section, although I didn't take them up on that. I was also ecstatic that  they had miniatures for Pathfinder and many other games. I don't play Warhammer, but they had a decent section of the wall dedicated to pieces from that game.

I didn't purchase any comics, but they seemed to have a good assortment. They also had other bits of nerdery: t-shirts, posters, statues, pins, materials for painting figures and dice. We ended up buying a lot of paint and brushes for painting our miniatures, and the employees\/other patrons were very helpful with their advice.

If I lived in the area I would definitely consider playing there."

I had an unusual experience at Green Grotto. I need to provide some context. 

My friend and I were going to Cavalia on a Friday night. The show started at 19:30. We needed a place to grab a bite before the show. She recommended coming here. I was game. 

I picked her up from her workplace at 17:00 and we headed over. 

This eatery is in the same plaza as Winners. I already knew that I would be coming back. I parked and we walked in. 

It wasn't too busy, but we had to wait for a table to be cleaned off. We sat in the waiting area and admired the coziness of the place. There were books and magazines that seemed like a decent place to hang out. 

While sitting there, I checked in on Yelp. Our table was ready, so we moved over there. 

The menu is in a magazine format, which was creative and cool. We got complementary popcorn as we figured out what we wanted to order. 

One of the staff members asked if one of us was Mary. I said that I was. He got an ""urgent call"" for me on the eatery's phone. That was odd, as only my friend and I knew that I was here. 

I took the call. Some guy, who wasn't articulate, said that that he was a manager who had to ""cancel [my] membership."" I asked him I repeat and clarify. He tried, but was incoherent​. I then ended the call and handed the cordless receiver to the staff person. 

My word of caution pertains to checking in on Yelp at this location. Obviously, this person had nothing better to do but take a look at check-ins, call this location, and waste my time. 

Anyway, my friend and I ordered the salt and pepper chicken (we opted to have it without rice), and Taiwanese fried rice noodles. We had wanted some other noodle dish, but the place was out of it. 

As for drinks, I went with an iced mango green tea with tapioca. My friend had requested a drink that was also unavailable and went with an iced matcha drink with jelly. I liked my drink. It was refreshing and yummy. She enjoyed herself, too. 

We both loved the salt and pepper chicken. Delicious! The fried rice noodles were different. It was okay in my books. It wasn't horrible, but it didn't wow me. 

For dessert, I wanted to give the tiramisu dessert a try. Guess what? It was unavailable. See a trend? My friend and I ordered the matcha crepe cake and chocolate truffle cake. We then attempted to use a knife to split them. Thank goodness we aren't surgeons! 

Both desserts were amazing! Two thumbs up from me. 

I love the cozy atmosphere of this place. Washrooms are clean. My friend had a rewards card. I don't know how it works here, but it's an app. You can definitely do takeout for all your bubble tea and food needs. Just be cautious about checking in.

The Egg Roll Vermicelli is a wonderful, unique, and pretty huge dish, could probably be split between two people.  And I highly recommend the Lotus Root Salad.

He went out and tried it with family and they all liked it and rave how much similarities it had to our favorite crawfish joint.

Today, I finally tried this place out and it's a Vietnamese restaurant with the seafood option. Pretty good especially when you're craving a bowl of seafood while others around you wants to eat pho, etc. 

[MY REVIEW IS SOLELY BASED ON THE SEAFOOD]

I got the #1 combo which consisted of black mussels, clams, crawfish and shrimp. It also came with two pieces of Italian sausage, two pieces of potatoes and three pieces of corn on the cob. The medium was spicy but I was still able to enjoy the meal without building up a sweat. :) My 6yr old and I were able to finish majority of it although if my husband were to eat some, we would've been able to finish it. Thus being, two adults sharing a bowl and it would be plenty. Now, the seafood is in a bag. They steam the seafood and then I'm assuming bag it, add the sauce, shake it up and serve. 

What I liked about it: 
They use a sauce to flavor up the seafood. Unlike the other joint down the street which used a dry seasoning. 
Crawfish and the other seafood were indeed fresh. The crawfish were huge which is a plus. The portion of the extras included (corn, sausage, and potatoes) were decent. 

What I didn't like:
The corn tasted a bit off as if it was previously boiled or was sitting in a pot of water overnight. It had a slight off taste. 

The restaurant is a bit small. So if you're bringing a large group, call ahead and reserve a table. Restrooms are pretty clean but nothing too special. No changing tables (for those mommies out there). Decor was those nets hanging around. It's okay considering they serve seafood and it was too tacky. 

Overall, if you liked Flamin' then you'll love it here. Only downside is that they don't have the MyTeas which was a favorite to compliment the spicy mix of seafood."

1) more time with my baby - check
2) opportunity to try a new place for dinner - check

With a quick search on Yelp, I found The Larder + The Delta. They had a very unique menu including fried Pig Ears with Cheetos flavoring, Seafood Perlou, Nashville Fried Chicken and many more. The Low Country Perlou was what really intrigued me and excited to try it. I'm a sucker for any type of seafood medley. 

The Larder + The Delta is located in the DeSoto Central Market which is an upscale and trendy food court. It was our first time at DeSoto's so it was kinda cool to be able to check out a few different places at the same time. 

We walked to the back to the L+D and ordered the Low Country Perlou ($23) and the Cauliflower ($8). It's definitely more than you would expect for a food court dinner. With tip and taxes, we were out about $38. Ouch! 

I have to admit that they were quite generous with the seafood items in the perlou. The seafood items included head on shrimp, clams, mussels and Andouille sausage. Unfortunately, the rice in the dish was over salted - inedibly salty. We ate all of the seafood out of it and left the rice. 

The cauliflower was tasty but $8 is a little bit too steep. 

With all of that said, I'd probably wouldn't come back as there are so many restaurants I have yet to ventured out to try.

Dr.Littman gave me results that were inconsistent with her reasoning to aggressively try to get pregnant.  She insisted upon hormone therapy shots and IUF even though my husband had not been tested and after she revealed that I had NOTHING wrong with me. 

I had also had medical records sent to the office that contained blood work.  She insisted that those blood panels were not what they needed and so she ordered new ones.  While she read the results to me, I recoginized them as being the same blood tests.  That is considered fraud, Doctor! 

After I refused to continue with treatment, she then informed me that my insurance was covering most of it and began to play upon the emotions of a woman getting older and asked me if I thought that It was all worth it to get a baby.  

And by the way, I'm in my early 30's, I'm NOT OLD and she gave no medical reasons to support why I am unable to conceive.  In fact, I was told that I am in perfect health with slightly high cholesterol. Yet, she's confident a prescription won't work and I need to get aggressive with injections and artificial insemination. Go fly a kite, lady!

Das Ambiente ist dementsprechend urig - auch der Biergarten sieht nett aus , wobei ich bisher immer drinnen gesessen bin.
Über die anderen Speisen kann ich nichts sagen, da ich bei bisher jedem Besuch nur Schnitzel und Salat gegessen habe.
Die Schnitzel sind 1A - dünn und lecker paniert.
Die Salatbar is ebenfalls gut 8und frisch und der Kartoffelsalat ist wirklich leciker, nach original schwäbischem Rezept.
Besonders zu empfehlen ist es am Montag dorthin zu gehen, da Montags Schnitzeltag ist man Schnitzel-All-U-can-Eat für 7,90 € wirklich ein tolles Angebot ist.
Das Restaurant ist dementsprechen voll und eine Reservierung sinnvoll - die Bedienungen haben demnach viel zu tun - sollten aber ihre Stress-Laune nicht am Kunden auslassen.
Trotzalledem eine Empfehlung von mir."

The food, however, was just ok! I felt like they skimped on the quality of some of the main ingredients (a hot dog bun, my friends, can truly be a make or break).

They have a small spa room inside the Body Spa which is this huge two story building almost like a mall for everything hair, skin, and nails :) 

This was my first experience with eyelash extensions. Jessica was my technician. She was very friendly, and her eyelashes still looked great after not having a fill for 4 weeks. She was VERY informative and answered any questions I may have had. 

During the procedure I unfortunately had a lot of tearing in just my left eye, which made the experience a little uncomfortable for me. There was also this one time I swear I had an eyelash plucked just cause there was this quick sharp pain, I said ouch, and she apologized. However, when my eyes would start watering she was very quick to fan them for me which was very relieving. After the 2 hours was done, and I was handed the mirror I LOVED my new lashes so much! They looked so  beautiful!  My eyes also instantly stopped watering. 

If anything I think I just might want my lashes fuller. Also at times (2 weeks later) I lost way to many lashes at one time, and I felt like I was being very gentle brushing them, but once again this was my first experience.  I would like to try another place just to have something to compare it to and see if I can achieve a more glamorous look, but I would still recommend this place. The look is very natural and you cant tell they are extensions at all. 

Also, had an issue with scheduling with my fill and it was an inconvenience for me. I had a noon appt scheduled, and the day before Renee will send texts to confirm your appointment, but she said 1pm in the text. I replied back with, ""I had noon written but 1pm is still fine."" She replied with just ""tomorrow"". I arrived at 1pm the following day and Jessica was busy with another client when I walked in and looked confused. She was very polite about the situation and tried to accommodate for me the following hour but I had so much to do that day (had a surgery the following day to prep for). 

So ya mixed feelings, but they are still a nice place for some Gorgeous New Lashes ;)"

I order the Pho Dip with a side of the House made chips.  The Pho dip itself is a play off of a french dip and is served with a side of Au Jus Pho.  The sandwich was quite nice. The meat was nice and juicy and the bean sprouts added a nice bit of freshness to it.  When you dipped the sandwich into the Pho juice it added a whole new layer to the sandwich.  Alone the sandwich would only be alright by the Pho dip is what bumped it up to a 4 star for me.  

The chips that they served where also a very nice addition to the experience.   They were nice and crisp and had a really good potato flavor to them.  There was just the right amount of salt so that it flavored them but did not over power them.  The chips where also very unique as I believe the seasoned with with flakes of nori.  As i was eating them it was a pleasant surprise.  

Over by the counter they have a section of Hot Sauces that they make in house.   Both of the ones I tried had great heat and flavor.  For me they were definitely HOT!!!! LOL This could also be because I took a HUGE scoop of the red one at one time.  

The restaurant itself is on the smaller end but is nicely decorated and modern in look.  The tables all have bamboo plant that are growing out of Buddha Shaped Beer Bottles.

There's about 27 places to climb with varying inclines and difficulty.  There's plenty of beginner walls, if you're a noob like me.  If you're looking at the walls and don't know what the number mean, 5.5 is usually the easiest and you go up in difficulty from there.

Went there with the family (2 adults, 2 kids) expecting a nice breakfast together.  The coffee was quite weak, and as it was served in a glass mug, kind of looked like tea.  

Kids had chocolate pancakes.   The portion was very healthy, even overly so, but there was nothing special about the flavor.

The eggs Benedict...true disappointment.  Eggs Benny is all about the Hollandaise, and this homemade version was of the caliber that you might find in a high school culinary class.  Lacked seasoning and was over-whisked.   The dish was sloppily put together -- a far cry from the visual treat that a well put together EB should present.  I wish I had snapped a photo to show you, but I actually didn't because it just wasn't visually appealing.  

Mimi's Cafe across Tatum provides a better and more consistent breakfast product that Tryst.

Their bathroom is only one stall so it is a bit of a convenience for a restaurant that size. The display of pickled jars and aged meat is a fun eye catcher as well as the view of the chefs cooking in the kitchen. 

Our food took a bit but they gave truffle fries to our large party to hold us over. 

We had the ice cream trio for dessert and the chocolate cheesecake was given for the birthday dessert for our friends birthday. The cheesecake was very rich and dense, but delicious. The ice cream was also very good, probably the most fresh I have ever had. 

My husband and I split a 10oz steak but our portions seemed only 4oz. We made up for it with the side dishes and ice cream though."

We had some sort of beef soft taco that was sooooo salty our tongues hurt after. The chicken salad\/nacho was drenched in guac and sour cream it got so soggy it looked too gross to eat. We did anyway (we paid for it after all) and regretted it immediately. Like the beef, it was very salty, the ingredients didn't come together and it was just so, so very wrong.

We ordered a fondue plate that was packed with waffle bites, brownies, marshmallows, strawberries, and bananas, accompanied with chocolate fondue of your choice (we chose white and milk chocolate). It was superb. Although the waitress warned us of the burnt waffle before putting down the plate (and offered to bring us a new waffle if the waffle was overdone.) It seemed kind of silly for me to even consider serving a burnt waffle in the first place if it was overcooked, so I took off one star.

We also ordered the classic hot chocolate (milk chocolate). It was great! Even better than the one I had at Mindy's!! If you are a hot chocolate lover, this is definitely the place to be. 

Next, we shared a tiramisu as recommended by the waitress. Wow. It was probably one of the best choices we made all night, aside from choosing to go to Juliette. The cake was light, not overly sweet, and had just enough taste of coffee to keep you on your toes, wanting more of the cake.

We appreciate that the sales associate took the time to listen to our needs and find a resolution that was not only acceptable but above and beyond our expectations. The sales associate was extremely professional, understanding, and sympathetic, which resulted in a smooth transaction and two very happy customers.
 
 Additionally, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the appearance of the store. To put it simply, the cosmetic department looks spectacular. The design, lighting, and boutiques make the act of shopping at Hudson's Bay a luxurious experience. To top it off, it was exciting to find great deals on products and to find out that Hudson's Bay now offers free WiFi with a cafe in the basement.

Originally had another tattoo in mind but due to complications (not artist's fault) had to do another tattoo design that I was planning on getting a little later down the road. Result was as expected of a professional and true artist, exceptional! Shop was clean and staff was super cool and friendly. Tattoos were priced right there with the quality you are getting. Roughly around 175-200 per hour it seems to be around. 

Would definitely recommend this shop for first timers (like myself) and veterans. They definitely have a wide array of artists who are capable of the spectrum of tattoos you might like from Neo-American to traditional black and gray to Japanese and the evil dead.

Side note: My wife wanted to get one of her piece touched up and had Chris Beck redone the original artist's color. Again, a professional and a gentlemen, his work is also awesome."

I bought a stainless steel pan for 79.95 at this location. I was very excited about it as i had been wanting one for a while and just moved into a new house after recently being married. The pan I purchased had a white sticker on the bottom of the pan that said made in china which was a little disappointing but not surprising but the main problem was the pan really really wobbled. It did not lie flat on any surface. This wasn't minor but major as I asked 3 other people's opinion on it. They're response was for 79.9, it should be brand new and not wobble. 
I took it back a few days later and was helped only by one employee because apparently all the rest were either to busy to be bothered or had something better to do like...  Nothing. 
I believe it was a newer lady Laurie or  Lauren that helped me because she was outstanding. She really actually WANTED to help me and gave me excellent advice.  She was obviously new and was working with what seemed to be 2 other people of authority as they threw their snootiness around. No other customers to help and neither of them would help her and when she asked them, the guy came over all grumpy and wouldn't even acknowledge my existence. ( my only thought is he's annoyed I may be returning something)( either way making me feel like crap).
Walking into your store with the pan, I, myself, didn't know what I was gonna do. 1) return pan 2) exchange pan or 3) upgrade to a better quality pan for More Money! 
I agreed to exchange it only because Laurie was so sweet and nice. 
It's been 3 days now and I'm sitting here doing this yelp review because I'm still so insulted. 
I am a regional manager for another store in this mall and I would fire my employee on the spot if they ever treated someone like this.

Their Peking duck is $30 and it includes only first course with a limit of 12 pancakes, the duck itself is rather fatty for my liking and their sauce is too concentrated.

I never like leaving my room without the do not disturb sign and sometimes I have experienced housekeeping come on in anyways, but not at the Paris which again was very nice. Each morning they call us if we are out and leave a message saying they will bring up anything needed. This hotel is also located to my favorite poker room at aria of course. Only problem with the location is that there is nowhere to cross for pedestrians. Luckily a taxi cab is only about $6-$7 each way."

Food: 3\/5, I got the original japanese style katsu. The cutlet was crispy and the sides were good but it wasn't special and I wish it came with a bit more sauce.

Service: 4\/5, it was definitely good. The server was nice and attentive and explained their menu well.  

Ambience: 3\/5, the seating was nice but there was this sour scent in the restaurant that was unsettling.

Price: 3\/5, around $18-$20 per person so meh for me since its just rice and cutlets..."

Second, they give me much needed pain killers and schedule an appointment with a doctor that week. That doctor looks at that very same x ray and says I have a FRACTURE...The people at this urgent care need a lot more education, to say the least. Ridiculous. .."

Posh without being pretentious, affordable, comfortable, friendly... everything that was missing from the Strip was found here. 

The rooms are wonderful, the bathrooms are incredible, and the views are amazing. Soaking in the tub while watching the Vegas lights at night is one of the most relaxing baths I've ever had.

I'd read previous complaints about the service and was nervous, but apparently management has read them too. Everyone went above and beyond to make sure we were happy.

The only thing I could find to complain about is the abbreviated pool hours, but that happens everywhere in Vegas. They want you in the casino, not relaxing by the pool. I'm not a gambler, so I can't really comment about the gambling. I spent $20 on slot machines and it disappeared quickly. *Shrug*

While we were there, there was a race exhibit.  This was quite interesting and thought provoking.

It was a bit pricey for what was being offered.  They do offer a year pass.  We didn't even go to the IMAX - that was extra.  We were only there for a few hours before we saw everything we wanted to and left.  Very educational though."

Even with a reservation, we waited for a table for about 40-45 minutes. Hostess was super nice and did keep us informed though. Once we got a table, we sat with empty drinks and no water for another 20-25 minutes. Manager finally came over and offered free apps which were very yummy. The food was surprisingly, for a chain restaurant, very good. Unfortunately, we had to ask for more water several times and once we paid, the waiter never returned... ever. We asked for more water yet again with a minor refill all around, and were dry again within minutes. Again, crickets on the waiter, and the water front. Not a horrible experience by any means, but come on... If you keep us hydrated, maybe, just maybe, we'll (probably) consider more wine instead of just desperately craving hydration.

My panang curry flavor was right.. kinda but what made it a disappointing experience was the fact that it came out like a soup! I've included a video of how watery it is. Oh and it came with onions.. which panang doesn't usually but I thought it was fine bc you can throw just about any vegetables my way and I would enjoy it except when it's a raw onion... and I love onions. Just not the raw ones. I really want to like this place since it's nearby my neighborhood but I can't. I've been here 3x and each time I try to give it a chance and get something new and hope for the best but every single time it tastes like fast food. Or like.. no love put into their food kinda thing. The pho is very bland. Even with a ton of fresh squeezed lime. The crab Rangoon just tastes like nothing special. Maybe if they would get a better wrap or thinner or something. I can't put my finger on it. The Thai tea I've got once and never again! And I absolutely love Thai tea. Sigh. Ok well the only thing that i did enjoy here is the spring rolls. I like how the noodles in the spring rolls are super thin. And I'm glad the peanut sauce is good.

We asked for the spicy salsa with the chips, never received it. Didn't even get our waters or drinks till after the food arrived, after we asked for it again. 

My husband has the special -- the sirloin with the chorizo, he was asked mild or spicy. He asked for spicy, got mild.

The place is lovely. A bit of hole in the wall vibe mixed with some comfy booths and tranquil colours make it a great spot for breakfast. I decided to go with the Guac Omelet which was amazing, and shared half of Tiffany's challah french toast - super yummy as well!

Our server, who was holding down the fort, was kind and patient and the vibe was totally a comfortable place I'd love to become a regular at. I can't wait to visit this place again when I'm in Toronto."

If they got rid of the old computers that not many people use they'd have a nice little area for kids.  Happy Bambino is right around the corner so I think it would get used.

This is, as you probably have already realized, a doughnut shop where you choose an icing and a topping for your plain doughnut. Yes, the doughnuts are admittedly not huge, but I think for $1.89 apiece it was a fair serving. The ordering process is easy and you either customize a doughnut or choose one of their designs. I went with mocha icing and bacon and M&M's for the topping. Admittedly, the m&m's might have been a bit over the top, but it was tasty. I think if the doughnut had been any larger it would have been too much. It is nice to see some interesting places coming to Westgate after all of the chain mediocrity that is already there."

I went recently with my mother who ordered their fish special to which she found the accompanying sauce overly salty at first, but complementing overall. The fish was very fresh, clean and not overcooked. Portions are good, we all left uncomfortably stuffed.

There is never a long wait, and the staff here are always friendly and exude a positivity, which at times is frustrating because they love everything on the menu so much, even the unsavory choices. My most recent waitress was vegan, and most of their dishes concocted from meat and cheese, I'm not sure how great her personal judgement could have been.

You can get better Italian for the price in the city, but is on the more reasonable side for its neighbourhood location."
1308371,S10Q9h_W-MKyog8IdcCNCQ,fNRr4znzjofFdtAfoBk0hw,3.0,"This store has two sections, the second you might easily miss out on.

Walking in you come into the store area, selection of costumes\/wigs and sfx make-up. The usual stuff you expect a place like this to have.

Although they have plenty of accessories with which you can put together an outfit there just is not enough full costumes sets, which I suppose from a business perspective is fine because this place can charge silly prices for individual accessories. 

They do keep a catalogue of outfits at the till counter from which you can take your pick and either they will try and get everything for you from the store or they can be made to order.

I am sure that within this area there is also a closed back room where an Asian man makes masks (reminded me of the key maker in matrix 2) and a ballerina outfit section (I may have just imagined this also) 

As I was exploring I saw a doorway leading into another large shop area and this was mainly for renting outfits. Now this was pretty crap nearly all the outfits were vintage, or Brave heart extra outfits but for Halloween definitely not much of a selection."

When we found this on yelp we were wondering why it had such high ratings. From the photos it looks like it's just a small bar next to slot machines--it looked ghetto. And when we got there, it was true, the place Really IS next to slot machines on the main floor of a casino. But it's also true that the food here is worth 5-stars

The price is actually pretty high--almost all items are $20+ and up, so be aware. The quality of the food is well worth it though--extreme comfort food, perfect for after long nights of gambling or other crazy shit you did in Vegas.

Word of caution--the spiciness rating here is insane. You choose spiciness from 1-10, and being a guy that eats spicy stuff everywhere I choose 7. Man was it hot. I think my max for this place is at most a 5.

Basically, whatever you think your spicy rating is, just minus 2 or more from it.

The seafood stew quality was amazing, with HUGE chunks of lobster, fish, clams etc Everything tasted fresh, with seawater freshness inside the flesh even though it's covered in broth. After I ate this meal I was full for the entire 8 hour drive back home. Definitely a bit meal with large portions.

Definitely a place to come back to again and again and again."

Suk: 4\/5

Not sure what stars were aligning on our last visit to Montreal but we were able to get into both of our first picks by calling day of.

Friday = Joe Beef

Joe Beef = Everything you have heard and more 

Everything you have heard and more = gluttony without apology.  

Our last minute reso's meant we were seated at the bar.  This may be a negative to some but for us was a big bonus as bar seating tends to be our preference.  

I forget our bartenders name but he was fantasticly fantastic.    Due to our bar seating, it was difficult to read the menu (regardless of it being in French) so rather than strain our necks and our memories of high school French, we had a conversation with the bar man about what we like\/don't like.  

What resulted was a meal we will never forget   Ever   

Oysters, yum.  

Pigs Head, what?   Redonculous amazing - if it is on the menu when you are there, do yourself a favour and eat it regardless of squeamishness.  I thought I would have a hard time with it and didn't.   It was one of the best things I have ever consumed.  Ever.   Like ever.  

Beef tongue, what?  For us, this was too much of a literal presentation as it was presented as it had existed.  A large tongue presented on a plate.   Visually, there was no denying we were about to eat a cow tongue.  We had told our barman we would be okay with it so we felt completed to eat it.   Essentially, it tasted like a dense beef hot dog so it wasn't terrible but it was just way too big of a portion for two people to finish.    Perhaps this was amplified by the fact that a 1\/4 of the way through I realized I was using my tongue to eat and taste the the equivalent of another animal.   I am not going to lie, there was an element of gag.   Maybe a little too ""farm to table""  for my enjoyment but that is my hypocrisy, not Joe Beefs.  

Veg time!!!!   Pastrami carrots.  Delicate thin carrot slices marinated in pastrami spices.   Yes please.   Every single day, yes please.  

Foie gras.  This is where the unapologetic gluttony becomes a CAPITAL statement.  This is also where Suk deviated from the best meal of his life to get me the f out of here.  So perfect and rich.  Our barman doubled up our portion of the foie and although it was so delicious, it was too ample and rich for us to end our meal with (says Suk)

Our experience at Joe Beef was fantastic, from the service to the atmosphere to the food.    It is rare restaurants with this type of notoriety deliver on their promise.  Joe Beef killed it   Thank you."

It is located in a small strip mall just north of Arrowood Rd.  Inside is relatively small but they make good use of the space.  The booths and tables are very colorful which helps brighten an otherwise boring decor.

I was greeted immediately and it's seat yourself here.  Once you are seated, someone comes with the complimentary chips and salsa.  As others have mentioned, their red salsa is quite watery and it is very mild.  The tomatillo salsa has a little kick to it.  The chips were decent.

I ordered the wet spinach burrito which was huge and filled with beans, rice, cheese, spinach and onions and covered with a red sauce.  It was ok.  Everything was a bit watery and the biggest flavor here was onion.  I am not sure if was the best introduction to the food here but I have recently been changing my diet and gave up meat for a while.  Perhaps there are better vegetarian items here or possibly a fish dish?

Anyway, the staff was very friendly here and food came out fast as it does with most Mexican places."

What I loved about it was the wine and the atmosphere. Oh and the fried olives. But what a selection of wine! Adam, the owner, is a connoisseur of just about anything wine, beer or whiskey. We; my friend and I and Adam, would sit and talk about a lot of things for hours. So yesterday I decided to stop by. There were a couple of people at the bar and only one other female besides me. It was so dark I had to wait a while before my eyes adjusted. Well it's changed a bit. The only wine available is Sutter Home in the small travel bottles. For $6 a pop, hence the 4 stars, really guys..... HOWEVER, Jason, the bartender, is the kind of employee everyone should have working for them. He saw my face when he said Sutter Home, not that it's bad, it's just not my particular taste. After a couple of minutes he asked how my wine was, I asked about the owner and mentioned the bar was bigger than I remember and blah blah. He went about his duties and a couple of minutes later he comes back with two bottles of wine that were chilled and unopened and asked me if I wanted a glass. Jason gets 5 stars for being resourceful, thoughtful and a damn good salesman. I respectfully declined, BUT..... that is how business is done. I know about the 1000 beers and 900 whiskeys but I remember the wine. I will go back because of that. Just wanted to let everyone know my thoughts about it....... ; )"

I ordered the lunch combo #1 Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice I also ordered the 3pcs Shrimp Tempura. The Chicken was pretty good for the price without the hot chili sauce it would have been a D- The shrimp Tempura was not crispy on the outside it was soggy that makes it a D- as well.

The steak special goes like this: you get a good sized steak, potatoes, green beans, soup or salad, and a beer for $8. AWESOME deal, but if only the quality was as good as the price. Can't have the bet of both worlds right?

I had a soup, which was Cream of Mushroom at the time. A bit watered down and lacked salt, but not too bad. The steak is where they just went downhill, but I really wasn't expecting anything better from such a place. It lacked any marination, was all burnt on the outside, and was just overall bland and charred. The mashed potatoes were great, though.

Also, they may claim to be the best brewery in Vegas, but I highly dispute that. Their dark beer was heavily watered down, was way too bitter for such a beer, and just didn't go with the meal at all.

In conclusion, get their mashed potatoes. Everything else sucks."

First off, when pulling into their parking lot, there is a very visible sign notifying customers that Macayo's is not responsible for any items stolen from customer's cars. Not so good. If you are openly warning me that break-ins are frequent in your parking lot, why should I eat here if there is a safer option somewhere else?

On the night I visited this location, four of us had stopped by to grab dinner before a concert. When we asked for a table, we were offered seats at the bar. No big deal - except that after we walked around the corner, we quickly learned that the bar was completely full. Back to the hostess station.

We are now walked back to another portion of the restaurant that is almost completely empty. Huh. In any case, our server promptly brought us drinks and kept the chips & salsa coming until my brother arrived.

One of my favorite entrees is the Baja Chimi, but I have to tell you that I was really disappointed with the one that I ate here. I chose shredded beef, but apparently at this location that includes gristle & fat that I don't normally receive at the other Macayo's locations. I'm not sure what the issue was here, but at least three times I bit into meat that was inedible.

Our server was very attentive and kept things moving, so kudos to him for doing an excellent job. Hostess station...not sure what was going on there. As customers were leaving, they never even thanked them for stopping by - or even wished anyone a good evening. In fact, the girls in the front appeared to be spending more time talking to each other than to customers. This is really not THAT big of a deal to me, but if it were my restaurant, I would probably extend myself a little more to thank my customers for choosing me over another establishment.

If you do decide to visit this Macayo's location before seeing a concert at the nearby Pavillion, plan on arriving there at least 2 hours before the show. If you arrive this far in advance, you will have no problem getting a table. One hour before the show and this place will be packed with concertgoers.

I am still a Macayo's fan, and I will still frequent the Depot Cantina location in Tempe - but I will probably not be returning to this location."

The restaurant is located in the MGM hotel.

Just like the name implies, it looks like you walked into a tropical jungle rain forest with lots of animal status and heads coming out of the forest like walls.  The bar is a giant mushroom, and the bar stools are different animal legs, which are very funny.

The staff\/servers were all very nice, helpful, and attentive.

The food is pricey, we paid about $100 for lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids, no liquor, but we did get the kids some really cool souvenir cups.  The prices are typical for any fun tourist type restaurant you'll be eating at in Vegas.

The menu selection is good, mainly focusing on burgers, sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes. 

All of the food was really good, and the portion size was large.

There is also a very large gift shop selling everything that is rain forest\/animal related; clothes, gifts, toys, etc.

It also came with a side salad with a housemade balsamic, and all for $16.50. The ribs were meaty and fall off the bone with an excellent rub.

On thursdays, they have $6 martinis including a double grey goose cucumber fresh martini.... are you serious? I can drink those things all night - tastes delicious and makes me happier by the second! Their food is pretty good also at a really afforable prices (compared to all the other high enders on the street). Their menu is pretty eclectic, anywhere from fish and chips, butter chicken, to pot pies and the whole nine yards.

I came during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, which meant we were able to get 5 dim sum dishes for the price of 4. Not bad, not bad. I was so pumped when I saw the tray going round and eagerly awaiting which dishes I would choose from! So the chick came round with the tray of 5 different dishes and we all grabbed them up.

I was able to try every dim sum item on the menu. How? Because that's all the options they had. I'm not privy to how most dim sum restaurants are, but I thought there would have been more options. I'm wondering if they're starting with the five (which seem to rotate out on different days when I peaked at the menu) and expanding from there. I'm actually hoping, more than wondering!

While the pork belly bites rocked my world, the others were tasty enough, like the cold soba noodles, steak tataki and shrimp salad. Looking forward to seeing what else they can come up with to rock my world 5 to 10 to 20 times more!

I was also excited to try some of the cocktails, since I'd heard they were pretty crafty (get it, craft cocktail??). I tried the G&G Club Cocktail $10 (bourbon, amaro, creme de cassis, orange bitters). It was good and STRONG. Be careful... 

I really like how they set the main menu up, aside from the dim sum. They list the plates by size. So the top of the list is smallest and runs to largest. While the short ribs $6 (cream cheese biscuits, aged white cheddar cheese, hollandaise) were AMAZING. We split between four people, when I really wanted to shove both biscuits in my mouth. So maybe share with two people:)

The salmon $17 (crispy pretzel bread pudding, braised cabbage, pickled mustard seeds) on the other hand was enough for one person, but we did split, with so much other food to share. I thought this dish was very creative and loved the homemade pretzel bread and cabbage. The salmon was also expertly cooked!

The tasso ham flatbread $14 (black garlic, olive oil, leeks, mushrooms, fontina cheese, kale, arugula) was also very good. Actually, come to think of it, the main dishes may have been better than the dim sum... I just came to this realization after typing all this out. I feel like they set out to potentially conquer dim sum in the Burgh... and hopefully they will, but for now it seems like main dishes rule."

(It pays to go during happy hour, peeps.)

I was apprehensive about the oysters. I'd never had them before and everything about them -- and the places they're usually served -- seemed sketchy. (I am nothing if a cautious eater.) But with some coaching and some fancy condiments, I downed about four of them without grimacing. I think having them first at Seablue put me at ease, but it also spoiled me, as I can't imagine them being this palatable at the next place I dare eat them. 

My favorite was the king crab, which needed nothing added to it. Just the most flavorful and appetizing crab meat I've ever consumed. That macaroni dish was something else, too. The consistency of the pasta is almost as good as it is at Scarpetta.

The driest wings in all existence were delivered to us and the pizza was very tough. We called to let them know that we were dissatisfied and we were met with nothing but rudeness. I get it. No one likes to hear complaints. But as someone who also works in retail\/customer service as a manager, you take the complaints and grow from them and make the customer happy.

Very small theatre, only about 50 seats.  The best thing about it was the really comfortable fully reclining chairs with foot rests, making it an enjoyable viewing.  Theater was clean and not too much obnoxious butyric-popcorn odour.  The one drawback is that the screen was small and the screen itself could have been better - anti-reflective lines on it were visible from the front row I was sitting in during the film.  Sound was reasonable.  Did not buy anything from the concession so I can't rate it.  Cheaper than Cineplex."

If you like variety, a trendy place to hang, and good service at reasonable prices, this is your place!

I came to this new restaurant for a late night dinner with a friend.
We ordered the Fusion Burger Crepes and The Aztec Crepes, and two black teas.  Additionally we ordered a chocolate mousse and S'mores crepes for dessert.

Firstly, the place is decorated in modern trendy décor, from the lighting to the wallpaper.  There is a variety of seating options: barstool by the counter, tables, booths, couches at tables, and couches around coffee tables.  So if you want to sit with your family, you have the single tables and chairs, and if you wanna throw back with friends, you have the couches!  
Yes, its a place for you and your boys, you and your girls, or the fam.

I've never seen such an extensive tea menu at a restaurant. So many options. It was fun to look through it.  The crepes and sandwich menu was also very cosmopolitan and extensive.  They had everything from Indian to Mexican to Japanese flavors.  

The staff was extremely attentive. They checked in often, asked for feedback, and cleared the dishes promptly.  The orders came quite promptly and when we requested other items like hot sauce or honey, they brought it quickly.  The staff was very nice; everyone.  

Food was great, tea was great, dessert was great.  So many options in the menu.  Interesting and exciting options.  The price was also reasonable.  $9.00 for the burger crepes, $9.00 for the desert crepes.  At this point, if you ordered crepes, a lil teapot of tea (about 4 tea cups worth) was just $2.00!!! You can't beat that!!!

Okay go there!!"
2164324,jr212HQAwMOXGYKkZLfQvA,5dSsBYJiMujrd8uJuVcJhA,4.0,"As the duly-designated Johnnie Cochran of this particular Starbucks at Gateway Village, it is my sworn duty to defend this location and say this to the 2-and 3-star reviewers: man, y'all don't know what you're talking 'bout.

I've been working here for 3 years, and this one's been my go-to spot for caffeine. So I can't really complain about such trivialities as parking (parking sucks all around here, so while the complaints are valid, I couldn't care less) and the fact that it gets crowded and busy. More on that in a bit. But when you walk into a particular Starbucks and the baristas not only know what you favor every day - in my case, a grande Misto w\/non-fat milk - but also have it ready before you reach the wait counter.

The great news about this location is the recent renovation, which sucked for me considering I was without a workday coffee fix for exactly 10 business days, and when you have to rely on that shitty-assed Keurig-brewed coffee I have to endure at home, or force yourself to walk from Gateway to N. Tryon on a spectacularly and stupidly hot afternoon, which, by the way, I'd rather suck on a wet and frayed towel than have to walk 6 city blocks in 95-degree weather just for a delicious cup of coffee...oh shit, where was I? The renovation, right. The biggest complaint was the lack of space at this location, and when folks were getting their fix between 8-10am and 2-4pm, you know this spot would get crazy crowded, and you really couldn't move around without accidently brushing someone's ass, and then have to wait for some slow poke to finish languidly stirring their mocha choca latta yay extra soy 5-pump coffee, it got pretty frustration. Thankfully, the renovation has not just created a better use of space - there's a nice and cozy sitting spot in the back - but it's even cheerful-looking, in a rustic sort of way. 

And then there's Sarah, the shift manager, a pint-sized, smart-ass (I love smart-asses) that runs a tight ship but makes everyone feel like they're the most important customer ever. The whole staff is great, friendly even, but Sarah is the shit.

Not all Starbucks are created equal, but this location works just fine for me. So there."

It's mostly Americanized Chinese food ala Panda Express.

The lunch specials are a really good deal.  You get the same size as the dinner portion but $2 off plus it comes with egg flower soup.  The downside is that the egg flower soup is pretty awful.

The garden tofu was pretty good.  A nice selection of fresh vegetables and good chunks of fried tofu.  The paper chicken was also good but searing hot and covered in foil.  I had to wait 10 minutes before I could even handle the foil. The Mongolian beef was sweet not spicy, which was annoying.

I've gotten takeout here twice and delivery once.  Each time, ordering was huge saga because the workers have limited English skills.  Which makes me think they have some hidden gems on their menu or off-menu.  But I don't have the patience or language skills to find out.  Delivery was super fast, which I appreciate.

3) Friendly, cool space (collaborative art chalkboard in the front!? feel free to add some of your own art to it!)

4) Great drinks and latte art, they know how run this place!

5) Last and quite possibly the most important for me - WiFi! I've finally found a great cafe, with large tables that I can come to and do some work.

This place is my new brunch locale. My partner and I came in for brunch before an excursion to the grocery store. Have you ever gone to the grocery store hungry? You end up with the weirdest stuff, and we weren't going to let that happen... again. We cozied up in a booth, and ordered some breakfast cocktails. I had a spicy Caesar, which came garnished with olives and dill and he had a hot buttered rum. He definitely won the cozy award, since he was sipping a warm apple rum beverage whilst wearing Uggs. Ugh. 

For food I had the lentils with kale and a poached egg add pork belly and he had the apple, bacon and blue cheese pizza add an egg. Both were excellent. Our breakfasts were a little slow coming out (this place is new, growing pains), which our server noticed without us saying a thing, and he offered us each another cocktail on the house. We  had the maple dark and stormy and I had a fresh grapefruit mimosa. This little attention to detail is why this place is a five star establishment. The food and drink is great, so is the ambiance, but they really go the extra mile. Incroyable.

Enter and there's a stairwell to an upstairs bar that looks like you're walking up tl a spaceship... sick first impression. 

Service was awesome. Server bearded man loved the food, new the menu cold, was helping us figure out what we wanted, killer suggestions, watched our table and took care of what came our way -- truly good service.  The way he described the food also really reflected how much the Chef and the kitchen staff invest into ingredients, flavor, and taste.  It's not just a list of items on this menu. 

The food... This morning I wished I didn't brush my teeth because I wanted to still taste what I had.  So goddamm good.  

1. Drinks: Tom Yum Booze - spicy, light, coconut water, spicy, light, coconut water.  Drink, repeat. It's like you just hit that combination over and over.  Not super boozy, spicy, a bit biting, refreshing.

2. Plates: Octopus tacos - beats out anything from Grand Electric, La Carnita, whatever. On a jicama shell which made it into this unique tortilla, and the fried octopus, and aioli, and pork belly ... delicious.  Pumpkin dumplings  - total knockout, and was like my first taste of love for Dailo.  The dumplings are good, really good, but the sauce?  Butter, truffle oil, soy, white rabbit candy glaze (wha?). You just think about what brown butter and truffle oil must taste like and you can imagine how good that must be. I was drinking this with a spoon. Forget the dumplings ... just the sauce. 
Halloumi - probably the weakest thing we ordered but still very good.  Got this with the tofu, and the black bean sauce is salty, different, with these pieces of tofu that give a nice chew.  It's very good, but the black bean sauce is just a bit overpowering for the rest of the flavors.  All very relative to everything else we had that night, of course... Singapore Curry Cauliflower - this is where you see the asian coming out.  

3. Mains:
I swear these two dishes made Dailo one of the most memorable dinners I've had in months. We got this tip from our server to get the cabbage with a remoullade of a cheese, in a sauce, along with the 90 day aged 12oz rib eye.  Seriously no words.  It's an expensive item ($44 for the rib eye) but the beef ... that beef ... Thd word ""succulent"" is made for moments like this.  The rib eye had a green chutney aioli drizzled on top, these pickled mushrooms, this bok chop, the steak was seared on the outside, totally breaking apart in your mouth.  Then you take the cabbage remoullade and put it on top... and it's like all three of us at the table were falling out of our booth. One of the best dishes I might have ever had.  Memorable would be an understatement.  

Just loved this place and for a restaurant that's apparently ""new,"" you wouldn't know it.  Dailo has got to be one of my favorite restaurants of the year.  Understated, the food is truly perfection, service just exudes a respect and love for that menu, and it's worth the experience.  Delicious spot.  Maybe one of Toronto's best right now?"

Recently, I found a pair of ""lonely only"" shoes that were originally $100, marked down 65%. So $35 for a pair of shoes that retails much higher, even online (my go-to reason for not buying something in a store)...can't beat it! The man working said he had just marked them down because they were the last pair. SCORE!

It's a good mixture of helpful customer service and leaving you to shop, which I appreciate. I loathe hovering employees who do nothing but talk up products. If I want help, I can ask for it. These guys get it right.

They also do killer end-of-season clearances that are worth looking into. Last year I found a Patagonia jacket for more than 50% off. Again, can't beat that. And I appreciate knowing my money is going right back into the local economy, instead of a big box store's stock prices.

The service was very fun and interactive. We watched bartenders put on a show making creative wacky drinks including one that had smoked burbon in a glass skull. 

The food was great! We shared a bunch of small plates including the chicken pot pie nuggets (my favorite), the bacon-n-egg, the tater tots and the crispy fried game hen.

Here is where the evening went from great to spectacular. After we finished our array of amazing food we still wanted something small to eat, so we started talking to the bartender. He said there was a special of that Rick Moonen was making for the evening of oysters with cucumber spheres created with molecular gastronomy. Now, I am always up for trying new things and am intrigued with the blending of science and food so we ordered them. Then about ten minutes later they were hand delivered by Rick Moonen himself! What a treat, we talked to him about his Top Chef Masters appearance and told him we were fans. Then he and the bartender created a custom gin drink to go along with the oysters. I have never liked gin or oysters but they were both unforgettable. The oysters were buttery and smooth with no fishy taste at all. The drink was spicy and floral and complimented the oysters just perfectly. Just goes to show that a great chef can elevate any food to be out of this world.
